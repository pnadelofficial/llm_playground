# llm_playground

This repo contains two files:
* `llm_ipyw.py`: This file contains all of the code needed to run a simple text generation interface using IPywidgets in a Jupyter notebook. HuggingFace Transformers models are only supported for now.
* `inference.ipynb`: This notebook imports the above file and sets up a simple interface for inferencing an LLM of your choice. 

Please reach out to me if you are interested in contributing or collaborating.
